% This code contains an example of updating the brior for every state
% we need to creat a 4D matrix which coontains every state in 
%
% This piece of code must be able to update and viualize the state space,
% as well as the force distribution of each state
%
%%

% our state space (only one state variable) is a 4D matrix, containing the
% following dimensions: (Fy, Fx, Vy, Vx)

% Example: a specific point in state space would have a specific Vx and Vy,
% and for this specific state we have a 2D distribution of force (X and Y).
